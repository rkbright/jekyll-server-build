Jekyll server build

/*
Working Notes:
When testing on GCP linux box I noted the following:
1. need to cross compile to linux/amd64
2. do not assume wget or curl are available on the machine
3. do not assume git is available on the machine
4. commands did not run on linux machine

--

* take package args from terminal
* get exit status and test for it....
see StackOverflow link ...
